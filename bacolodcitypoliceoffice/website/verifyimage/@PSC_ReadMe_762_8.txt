Title: Image Verification (updated)
Description: This tutorial will show you how to make an image verification
like they use (used?) on Yahoo or they still do on Planet Source 
Code. It is quite useful in order to prevent users from writing 
scripts that would do the voting, posting or whatever. Now, 
whenever a user wants to vote for something, he gets an image 
with a randomly generated string, that consists of uppercase and
lowercase characters and numbers from 0 to 9.
He then has to enter the string he sees on the picture and only
if the code is correct, he will be allowed to proceed.
I hope this code will help you. I admit, i took the idea from
a recent post on Planet Source Code. (can´t remember, who it was) But the method used was too
unsecure and relied on posting variables. :)
